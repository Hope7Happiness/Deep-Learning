# Deep Learning

üõ†Ô∏è This repository is currently under development!

It is well known that studying deep learning, especially learning the practical details, requires a lot of computational resources. However, this repository aims to explain xxx Deep Learning algorithm/papers **within (a total of) xxx 4090 Hours**.

The results may not be optimal and are mostly carried out on toy datasets (e.g. MNIST, CIFAR10, etc.) but the code is fully functional and can explain the basic ideas of the algorithm.

Most of the code are in `ipynb` notebook format with explanations and comments.

## Collaborating

You can collaborate by opening up a branch with name `name.task` (e.g. `zhh.resnet`) **from the commit [ac0e128](https://github.com/Hope7Happiness/Deep-Learning/commit/ac0e128dec6b46c28884a0fe851b71d07ba364ac)**. Your own branch can contain development code for future usages, but the `main` branch will only keep your final notebook.

The code should not be too complicated and should be able to run on a single 4090 GPU.

## Installation

The code should be generally runable on **Python 3.10 + Pytorch 2.2**. For specific tasks, you may have to install additional dependencies based on its instructions.
